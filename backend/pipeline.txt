How to use stock analyze pipeline?

1. Prepare data in csv form and put in /data folder
  - format with 2 columns, date and price
  - format in date oldest -> newest order
  - use the close price as normal
  - use preferably shortest timeframe - daily, hourly, mins

2. Run stragegy testing code, currently in /binance folder
  - will get printing output and trades in a json file

3. Look at output in the /binance folder
  - for now, dont really see a consistently winning stragegy

BN -> JSON 
AVAN -> JSON 

JSON -> calculate rolling coint -> calculate signal

JSON -> SQL
rolling coint, signal -> SQL
